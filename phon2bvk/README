The code "harm2fcs.py" takes as input a "HARMONIC" file and a symmetries file
"S.pkl" and produces the following two pickle files:

bonds.pkl          a list of all of the (non self-) bonds in BvK compatible 
                     format
sortedBonds.pkl    a list of lists of lists of tuples, sB[a][b][c] where:
        a indexes (bond length && atom types)
        b indexes bond types (all with the same (bond length && atom types))
        c indexes tuples, where the first number in the tuple is the index
            of the bond in the list from "bonds.pkl", and the second index
            gives the appropriate element in "S.pkl"

It also overwrites "S.pkl" with a copy that has 0.0 in the place of _very_ 
small numbers, and has the identity matrix at the start of the list.

It currently has two magic numbers, both at the top of the file:
  a = 1.177245   This is a number to normalize bond vectors to integers.
                    "harm2fcs.py" should be rewritten without it!
  c = -16.021765 Converts VASP/PHON (eV/angstrom?) force constant units to N/m.
