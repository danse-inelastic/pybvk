cubicMPGrid:
  - It's in c++, make it c.  
  - Does it really need it's own Vector3.H ?

directionalQs:
  - Better input -- so it doesn't require recompilation.
    - Can this utilize the system file, somehow -- so a user can just pick 
      a direction, and not worry about magnitudes?
  - Can we use vector from bvk?
  - We need dispersion output.  Using Omega2 and WeightedQ is ok, but ascii 
      might be nice here.

randomQs:
  - Can we 
.svn/
h.c
mk*

NEEDED:
  - qs on a grid in the IBZ

DESIRED:
  - MP Grids for arbitrary structure
  - Other ``magic'' grids.
  - Grid inside specified volume (Real or reciprocal volume? Both?)
