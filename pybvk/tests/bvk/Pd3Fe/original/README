This directory contains data files from Lisa Maugar for Pd3Fe.
The files are in the original file format that is supported by
Max's bvk code.

Use 
 ./run.sh

to run a computation of phonon density of states and plot it.


 * run.sh: compute and plot phonon DOS
 * pd3fe.py: the bvk model in Max's format. When run, it generates "system" file
 * System.py: needed by pd3fe.py
 * syms: a directory with symmetry files needed by pd3fe.py
