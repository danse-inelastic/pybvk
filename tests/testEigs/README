In order to use this, you first have to set everything up.  
  Copy these files into the bvk/newbvk directory, 
OR 
  copy bvk/newbvk/* (including input-generators) into a directory, then copy
    these files into the same directory. 

Make sure that mk actually works -- there are often issues with acml.

Then you type:

$ ./manyTest.py <System_Name> <Number of basis vectors> <Number of tests to run>

For example, you might like to test B2 NiAl 10 times:

$ ./manyTest.py NiAl 2 10
